## Hi there ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ / OlÃ¡ :portugal: / Hola :es: / Ciao :it: :pinched_fingers: ! :call_me_hand:
### I'm Lafaiete do Vale (Lafa) from Brazil, and I can talk to you in these four languages.

I'm an advertiser and digital marketer who was looking for a way to work remotely and had to start coding to survive, specially in the pandemic.
Fortunately i felt in love with it too, because it brought me a new sea of possibilities to give life to my ideas.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio to get my first developent job and start this new amazing career.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel, VueJS, Node.js, Express, Angular, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web and mobile development at this first moment, but someday in a few years on IOT.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @lafadovale or lafa.vale@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can hold my breath for ten minutes.

### Hi there ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ / OlÃ¡ :portugal: / Hola :es: / Ciao :it: ! :call_me_hand:
### I'm Lafaiete do Vale (a.k.a. Lafa) from Brazil, and I can talk to you in these four languages.

I'm an advertiser / digital marketer / photographer who was chasing a remote life for these last five years. The pandemic was just the final push for that.
Fortunately i felt in love with it coding, because it brought me a new sea of possibilities to my crazy ideas.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on so many projects to show you here in a few days. Maybe with them you feel like hiring me and we talk about them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Laravel, Node.js, Express, React with NextJS, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web and mobile development at this first moment, but I think of working on IOT someday.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @lafadovale or lafa.vale@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can hold my breath for ten minutes. (Nahh, only Guybrush Threepwood can do that)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lafaiete do Vale (Lafa)

I'm a former advertiser post-graduated in digital marketing who was looking for a way to work remotely and had to start coding to survive, specially in the pandemic.
Fortunately i felt in love with it too, because it brought me a new sea of possibilities to give life to my ideas.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel, VueJS, Node.js, Express, Angular, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web and mobile development at this first moment, but someday in a few years on IOT.
